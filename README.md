## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned

While developing this project, I tried to build using CSS Grid. Normally, I only use Flexbox and it was cool to make it in a different way, which I found to be much easier than just using Flexbox or float.
